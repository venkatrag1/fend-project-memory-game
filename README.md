## Instructions

Open index.html from top level directory.

The goal of the game is to match all pairs of identical cards in consecutive opens.

The timer will start when the first card is opened. If the next card doesn't match
currently opened cards, both cards will close.

To re-start the game at any time, hit the reset button.

If you complete opening all cards within 20 moves, you will get 3 stars. If you
take between 21 to 40 moves, you will get 2 stars and for move count greater than 
40 you will get one star.

## Dependencies

The project makes use of several css frameworks and js libraries, such as 
font-awesome, tingle, animate.css all of which are either packaged into 
the appropriate assets folder or referenced in index.html from CDN.
